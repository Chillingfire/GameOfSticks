# GameOfSticks

<b><i>Learning Purpose of this Project:</b> To create a game that utilized artifical intelligence created completely from scratch without any AI-related libraries or resources.</i>

This repository hosts a program that allows someone to play the "Game of Sticks" with another person, or an AI with adjustable difficulty.

In the "Game of Sticks", there is a collection of sticks. On their turn, each player picks up 1 to 3 sticks. The one who has to pick the final stick is the loser.
